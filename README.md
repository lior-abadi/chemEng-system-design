# chemEng-system-design
Design of a chemical process that synthesizes Formaldehyde. All calculus and design drafts are made via Visual Basic code integrated with Excel &amp; Hysys/Unisim.

The corrected projects are kept private to preserve the know how of the teachers who reviewed the files. Major errors are commented in the beggining of the following release (e.g. corrections to the TP1 are shown in the main page of the TP2 and so on).
